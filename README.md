# Clustering

## K-Means Clustering:

K-Means clustering is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm used for partitioning a dataset into distinct clusters based on similarity. It is widely used for various applications, including customer segmentation, image compression, and anomaly detection. Here's how K-Means works, along with some important points to consider:

**1. Initialization:**
* Choose the number of clusters, K, that you want the data to be divided into.
* Initialize K cluster centroids randomly or using a specific initialization method like k-means++

**2. Assignment Step:**
* For each data point, calculate the distance to each cluster centroid (usually using Euclidean distance).
* Assign the data point to the nearest cluster centroid. This step creates K clusters.

**3. Update Step (Centroid Recalculation):** Recalculate the centroids of each cluster by taking the mean of all data points assigned to that cluster.

**4. Iteration:** Repeat the Assignment and Update steps iteratively until convergence. Convergence is achieved when the centroids stabilize or a maximum number of iterations is reached.

**5. Final Result:** The algorithm produces K clusters, and each data point belongs to one of these clusters.

### Key Points and Considerations:

1. Number of Clusters (K): Choosing the right number of clusters is important. An inappropriate K value can lead to overfitting or underfitting. Techniques like the Elbow Method or Silhouette Score can help determine the optimal K.
2. Initialization: The initial placement of centroids can influence the final clusters. k-means++ initialization can provide more robust starting centroids.
3. Convergence: K-Means may converge to a local minimum, which means different initializations can result in different outcomes. Multiple runs with different initializations can help mitigate this issue.
4. Cluster Shapes and Sizes: K-Means assumes clusters to be spherical and equally sized. It may not perform well on non-linear or irregularly shaped clusters.
5. Sensitive to Outliers: Outliers can significantly impact the cluster centroids and affect the clustering results.
6. Scaling: It's important to scale the features before applying K-Means, as it is sensitive to the scale of the data.
7. Trade-off between Interpretability and Performance: K-Means provides simple and interpretable clusters but might not capture complex data patterns as effectively as other algorithms like DBSCAN or hierarchical clustering.
8. Choosing the Right Distance Metric: K-Means uses Euclidean distance by default, but for data with different characteristics, alternative distance metrics may be more appropriate.

## t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding)
t-SNE is a dimensionality reduction technique used for visualizing high-dimensional data in a lower-dimensional space (typically 2D or 3D). It aims to preserve the pairwise similarities between data points in the original high-dimensional space while revealing underlying patterns and clusters. t-SNE is particularly effective at capturing local structures and is commonly used for exploratory data analysis and visualization.
